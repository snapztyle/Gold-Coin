# Component introduction

The smart contract library template covers common codes from basic types to upper-level business, and users can refer to and reuse them according to actual needs.

## Solicitation of contract
 In order to cover and meet the demands of increasingly rich developers and industries, the smart contract code solicitation order is now issued to the majority of blockchain-loving developers and partners.
 
 This event is based on the Solidity language soliciting smart contract codes. **Version range: 0.4.25-0.6.10**.

In order to facilitate participation, we have drawn up a partial task list (as shown in the table below). Each participant can choose the task he or she is interested in to receive and develop, or it can be a development task based on a specific business scenario. In principle, no code function is required. The limit. At the same time, since each task is an overview description and contains more content, each task can be picked up by multiple participants.

|Task ID	| Task category| Task name	| Task description|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|1 |   Original contract function	| Optimization and enhancement of the original contract library	|Supplement and enhance the functions of existing contracts in the smart contract library, such as providing arrays, strings, addresses, mathematical calculations and other operations for different data types.|
|2 |   Original contract function	| Floating point, fixed point	|Solidity itself has no relevant support, and needs to allow functions such as specified precision and four arithmetic operations.|
|3 |   Original contract function	| Math enhancement	|Provide square root, exponent, logarithm and other operations.|
|4 |   Original contract function	| Bit manipulation	|Provides various bit operations, such as taking the leftmost or rightmost 1 of an integer, etc.|
|5	|   New data structure	| Two-dimensional array	|For different data types, it provides operations such as adding, deleting, modifying, checking, traversing, and existence of a two-digit array.|
|6	|	New data structure	| Collection	       | For different data types, it provides operations such as creation, addition, deletion, modification, search, traversal, and existence of a set (Set).|
|7	|	New built-in functions	| Built-in function	|Provide corresponding functions based on built-in functions such as block, msg, tx, etc.|
|8	|	New built-in functions	| Time operation	|Provide year, month and day time calculation, conversion and query functions|
|9 |   New function module	| Counter operation | Provide counter function based on solidity|
|10 |  	New function module	| Privacy computing	|Provide contracts related to privacy calculations, such as zero-knowledge proofs, etc.|
|11 |  	New function module	| Anonymous voting	|Anonymous voting is realized. During the voting period, the information of each vote is on the chain in ciphertext, and it will be made public after the voting ends.|
|12 |  	New function module	| Agent execution	|A proxy contract, which mainly includes interfaces for adding functions to be executed, expiration time, function execution, etc.|
|13 |  	New function module	| Permission operation	|Provide functions such as creating, assigning, and canceling permissions|
|14 |  	New function module	| Multi-signature	|Provides an abstract level of multi-party signature function, which can be applied to multi-party authentication scenarios|
|15 |  	New function module	| Multi-party voting	|Provide multi-party voting function, voting strategies can be diversified|
|16 |  	New function module	| Black and white list	|Provides the creation, query, traversal, addition and deletion of black and white lists|
|17 |   New scene	| Commodity traceability	|It can provide related solution cases of smart contracts for the whole life cycle of commodity traceability or one of the links.|
|18 |  	New scene	| Copyright protection	|Including but not limited to cultural, patent, artwork, digital content confirmation, authentication and other programs.|
|19 |  	New scene	| Finance	   |For financial scenarios such as supply chain finance, credit investigation, and anti-money laundering, provide relevant smart contract generalized templates.|
|20 |  	New scene	| Charity	|Based on charity and public welfare, provide but not limited to use scenarios such as traceability of donations, incentives for good deeds, etc.|
|21 |  	New scene	| File management	|Provides the realization of functions related to file management, including but not limited to use scenarios such as personal resume, academic certificate, honor certificate, etc.|
|22 |  	New scene	| Sharing economy	|Aiming at the pain points in the sharing economy, provide blockchain solutions, such as renting houses, book sharing and other usage scenarios.|
